# Meal Roulette App

**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Install the dependencies

First, you will need to install all dependencies required,

To install this, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
npm i
```

To run the app on iOS platform, you also need to setup the pods first. For this, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
npm run pod-reset
```

## Step 2: Start the Metro Server

Secondly, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following script from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
npm run start
```


## Step 3: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

###### For Android

```bash
npm run android
```


###### For iOS

```bash
npm run ios
```

## Issues

If you are having some issues running the app, run the following script to clear all caches and install everything from scratch.

```bash
npm run cleanNpm
```
